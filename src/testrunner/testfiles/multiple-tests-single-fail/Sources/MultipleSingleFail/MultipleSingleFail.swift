I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster,

25yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one
woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that’s
certain; wise, or I’ll none; virtuous, or I’ll never cheapen
her; fair, or I’ll ever look on her; mild, or come not near
